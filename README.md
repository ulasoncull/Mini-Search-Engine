# Mini-Search-Engine
It is a mini search engine created by extracting data from 100 txt files.
In this project, i implemented a hashing algorithm in Java to index words of 100 different documents . I readed these documents, splitted it word by word, and index each word to your hash table according to rules given below. After insertion of all documents, the user will query for a sentence that contains 3 words splitted by a single space. After that my algorithm brings most relevant document.
